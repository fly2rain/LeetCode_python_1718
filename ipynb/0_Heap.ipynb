    "### Abstract:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In computer science, a **heap** is a specialized **tree-based** data structure that satisfies the **heap property**:\n",
    "    * **heap property**: if $P$ is a parent node of $C$,\n",
    "        - then the key (the value) of $P$ is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) the key of $C$.\n",
    "        - or less than or equal to (in a min heap) the key of $C$.\n",
    "    - **图例**: Example of a binary __max-heap (看来还有 min-heap)__ with node keys being integers from 1 to 100\n",
    "        ![Example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Max-Heap.svg/320px-Max-Heap.svg.png)\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **基本概念**: The node at the \"top\" of the heap (with no parents) is called the root node.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **用途-priority queue**: \n",
    "        - The heap is one **maximally efficient implementation** of an abstract data type called a **priority queue**, and in fact priority queues are often referred to as \"heaps\", regardless of how they may be implemented. \n",
    "    - **实现方式-binary heap/tree** : A common implementation of a heap is the binary heap, in which the tree is a binary tree (see figure)\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- 性质:\n",
    "    - In a heap, the highest (or lowest) priority element is always stored at the root. A heap is __not a sorted__ structure and can be regarded as **partially ordered**.\n",
    "    - When a heap is a **complete binary tree**, it has a smallest possible height—a heap with N nodes and for each node $a$ branches always has $log_a N$ height.\n",
    "    - A heap is a useful data structure when you need to remove the object with the highest (or lowest) priority.\n",
    "    - The maximum number of children each node can have depends on the type of heap, but in many types it is at most two, which is known as a __binary heap__.\n",
    "    - Example of a complete binary max-heap with node keys being integers from 1 to 100 and how it would be stored in an array. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)#/media/File:Heap-as-array.svg\n",

    "    - heaps are binary trees where every parent node has a value less than or equal to any of its children. \n",

    "    \n",
    "- Two differences from the textbook:\n",
    "    - We use __zero-based indexing__. This makes the relationship between the index for a node and the indexes for its children slightly less obvious, but is more suitable since Python uses zero-based indexing.\n",
    "    - Our pop method returns the smallest item, not the largest (called a “min heap” in textbooks; a “max heap” is more common in texts because of its suitability for in-place sorting).\n",
    " \n",
    "- These two make it possible to view the heap as a __regular Python list__ without surprises: __heap[0]__ is the smallest item, and __heap.sort()__ maintains the heap invariant (不变量), 其实 heap 是almost sorted的例子, 因此用insert sort是很合适的, 估计是 $O(n)$ runtime! \n",

    "* <span class=\"burk\"><span class=\"burk\">特性</span></span>: it is <span class=\"girk\">efficient in practice</span> and <span class=\"girk\">has good average-case performance</span>, but <span class=\"girk\">has poor worst-case performance</span>. \n",
    "* <span class=\"burk\">特性:</span> As with quicksort, quickselect is generally implemented as an <span class=\"girk\">in-place algorithm</span>, and beyond selecting the k'th element, it also partially sorts the data.\n",
    "* <span class=\"burk\">具体内容 (quicksort 和 quick select的关系)</span>: \n",
    "    * Quickselect uses the same overall approach as quicksort, <span class=\"girk\">choosing</span> one element as a pivot and <span class=\"girk\">partitioning</span> the data in two based on the pivot, accordingly as less than or greater than the pivot. \n",
    "    * However, instead of recursing into both sides, as in quicksort, <span class=\"girk\">quickselect only recurses into one side</span> – the side with the element it is searching for. This reduces the average complexity from $O(n log n)$ to $O(n)$, with a <span class=\"girk\">worst case of</span> $O(n^2)$.\n",
    "    * Quickselect is <span class=\"girk\">sensitive to the pivot</span> that is chosen. If good pivots are chosen, meaning ones that consistently decrease the search set by a given fraction, then the search set decreases in size exponentially and by induction (or summing the geometric series) one sees that performance is linear, as each step is linear and the overall time is a constant times this (depending on how quickly the search set reduces).\n",
    "    * However, if bad pivots are consistently chosen, such as <span class=\"girk\">decreasing by only a single element each time</span>, then worst-case performance is quadratic: $O(n^2)$. This occurs for example in searching for the maximum element of a set, using the first element as the pivot, and having sorted data."
