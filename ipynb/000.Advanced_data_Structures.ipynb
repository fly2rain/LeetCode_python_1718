    "* In computer science, a **heap** is a specialized **tree-based** data structure that satisfies the **heap property**:\n",
    "    * **heap property**: if $P$ is a parent node of $C$,\n",
    "        - then the key (the value) of $P$ is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) the key of $C$.\n",
    "        - or less than or equal to (in a min heap) the key of $C$.\n",

    "        - The heap is one **maximally efficient implementation** of an abstract data type called a **priority queue**, and in fact priority queues are often referred to as \"heaps\", regardless of how they may be implemented. \n",

    "- 性质:\n",
    "    - In a heap, the highest (or lowest) priority element is always stored at the root. A heap is __not a sorted__ structure and can be regarded as **partially ordered**.\n",
    "    - When a heap is a **complete binary tree**, it has a smallest possible height—a heap with N nodes and for each node $a$ branches always has $log_a N$ height.\n",
    "    - A heap is a useful data structure when you need to remove the object with the highest (or lowest) priority.\n",
    "    - The maximum number of children each node can have depends on the type of heap, but in many types it is at most two, which is known as a __binary heap__.\n",
    "    - Example of a complete binary max-heap with node keys being integers from 1 to 100 and how it would be stored in an array. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)#/media/File:Heap-as-array.svg\n",
    "    - Heaps are usually implemented in an array (fixed size or dynamic array), and do not require pointers between elements. [具体查看 wiki 链接 的 Implementation 部分].\n",
