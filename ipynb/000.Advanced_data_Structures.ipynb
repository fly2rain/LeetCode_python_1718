    "* In computer science, a **heap** is a specialized **tree-based** data structure that satisfies the **heap property**:\n",
    "    * **heap property**: if $P$ is a parent node of $C$,\n",
    "        - then the key (the value) of $P$ is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) the key of $C$.\n",
    "        - or less than or equal to (in a min heap) the key of $C$.\n",
    "    - **图例**: Example of a binary __max-heap (看来还有 min-heap)__ with node keys being integers from 1 to 100\n",

    "        \n",
    "    - **基本概念**: The node at the \"top\" of the heap (with no parents) is called the root node.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **用途-priority queue**: \n",
    "        - The heap is one **maximally efficient implementation** of an abstract data type called a **priority queue**, and in fact priority queues are often referred to as \"heaps\", regardless of how they may be implemented. \n",
    "    - **实现方式-binary heap/tree** : A common implementation of a heap is the binary heap, in which the tree is a binary tree (see figure)\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- 性质:\n",
    "    - In a heap, the highest (or lowest) priority element is always stored at the root. A heap is __not a sorted__ structure and can be regarded as **partially ordered**.\n",
    "    - When a heap is a **complete binary tree**, it has a smallest possible height—a heap with N nodes and for each node $a$ branches always has $log_a N$ height.\n",
    "    - A heap is a useful data structure when you need to remove the object with the highest (or lowest) priority.\n",
    "    - The maximum number of children each node can have depends on the type of heap, but in many types it is at most two, which is known as a __binary heap__.\n",
    "    - Example of a complete binary max-heap with node keys being integers from 1 to 100 and how it would be stored in an array. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)#/media/File:Heap-as-array.svg\n",
    "    - Heaps are usually implemented in an array (fixed size or dynamic array), and do not require pointers between elements. [具体查看 wiki 链接 的 Implementation 部分]."

    "\n",
    "- Heaps property:\n",
    "    - heaps are binary trees where every parent node has a value less than or equal to any of its children. \n",
    "    - $heap[k] \\leq heap[2k + 1]$ and $heap[k] \\leq heap[2k + 2]$, for all $k$, __counting elements from zero__.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Two differences from the textbook:\n",
    "    - We use __zero-based indexing__. This makes the relationship between the index for a node and the indexes for its children slightly less obvious, but is more suitable since Python uses zero-based indexing.\n",
    "    - Our pop method returns the smallest item, not the largest (called a “min heap” in textbooks; a “max heap” is more common in texts because of its suitability for in-place sorting).\n",
    " \n",
    "- These two make it possible to view the heap as a __regular Python list__ without surprises: __heap[0]__ is the smallest item, and __heap.sort()__ maintains the heap invariant (不变量), 其实 heap 是almost sorted的例子, 因此用insert sort是很合适的, 估计是 $O(n)$ runtime! \n",
    "    - To create a heap, use a list initialized to __[ ]__, \n",
