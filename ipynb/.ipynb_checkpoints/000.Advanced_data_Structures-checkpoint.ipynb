    "* In computer science, a **heap** is a specialized **tree-based** data structure that satisfies the **heap property**:\n",
    "    * **heap property**: if $P$ is a parent node of $C$,\n",
    "        - then the key (the value) of $P$ is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) the key of $C$.\n",
    "        - or less than or equal to (in a min heap) the key of $C$.\n",
    "    - **图例**: Example of a binary __max-heap (看来还有 min-heap)__ with node keys being integers from 1 to 100\n",
    "        ![Example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Max-Heap.svg/320px-Max-Heap.svg.png)\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **基本概念**: The node at the \"top\" of the heap (with no parents) is called the root node.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **用途-priority queue**: \n",
    "        - The heap is one **maximally efficient implementation** of an abstract data type called a **priority queue**, and in fact priority queues are often referred to as \"heaps\", regardless of how they may be implemented. \n",
    "    - **实现方式-binary heap/tree** : A common implementation of a heap is the binary heap, in which the tree is a binary tree (see figure)\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- 性质:\n",
    "    - In a heap, the highest (or lowest) priority element is always stored at the root. A heap is __not a sorted__ structure and can be regarded as **partially ordered**.\n",
    "    - When a heap is a **complete binary tree**, it has a smallest possible height—a heap with N nodes and for each node $a$ branches always has $log_a N$ height.\n",
    "    - A heap is a useful data structure when you need to remove the object with the highest (or lowest) priority.\n",
    "    - The maximum number of children each node can have depends on the type of heap, but in many types it is at most two, which is known as a __binary heap__.\n",
    "    - Example of a complete binary max-heap with node keys being integers from 1 to 100 and how it would be stored in an array. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)#/media/File:Heap-as-array.svg\n",
    "    - Heaps are __usually implemented in an array__ (fixed size or dynamic array), and __do not require pointers between elements__. [具体查看 wiki 链接 的 Implementation 部分]."

    "\n",
    "- Heaps property:\n",
    "    - heaps are binary trees where every parent node has a value less than or equal to any of its children. \n",
    "    - $heap[k] \\leq heap[2k + 1]$ and $heap[k] \\leq heap[2k + 2]$, for all $k$, __counting elements from zero__.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Two differences from the textbook:\n",
    "    - We use __zero-based indexing__. This makes the relationship between the index for a node and the indexes for its children slightly less obvious, but is more suitable since Python uses zero-based indexing.\n",
    "    - Our pop method returns the smallest item, not the largest (called a “min heap” in textbooks; a “max heap” is more common in texts because of its suitability for in-place sorting).\n",
    " \n",
    "- These two make it possible to view the heap as a __regular Python list__ without surprises: __heap[0]__ is the smallest item, and __heap.sort()__ maintains the heap invariant (不变量), 其实 heap 是almost sorted的例子, 因此用insert sort是很合适的, 估计是 $O(n)$ runtime! \n",
    "    - To create a heap, use a list initialized to __[ ]__, \n",

    "* __AVL tree or height balanced binary tree__\n",
    "    * It is a variation of the Binary tree where height difference between left and right sub tree can be at most 1. If at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property. Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take $O(\\log n)$ time in both the average and worst cases, where n is the number of nodes in the tree prior to the operation.\n",
    "* __Red-Black tree__:\n",
    "    * Another variant of binary tree similar to AVL tree it is a self balancing binary search tree. In this tree nodes are either colored red or black.\n",
    "* __Splay tree (伸展树)__:\n",
    "    * A splay tree is a self-adjusting binary search tree with the additional property that recently accessed elements are quick to access again. All normal operations on a binary search tree are combined with one basic operation, called splaying. Splaying the tree for a certain element rearranges the tree so that the element is placed at the root of the tree.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* __N-ary tree__:\n",
    "    * In this tree the limitation of the binary tree is removed. Here a node can have at most n children. Like binary tree it can be full,complete or perfect n-ary tree. N-ary is some time known as forest.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* __Trie Structure__:\n",
    "    * In computer science, a trie, also called digital tree and sometimes radix tree or prefix tree (as they can be searched by prefixes), is an ordered tree data structure that is used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. All the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node, and the root is associated with the empty string.\n",
    "* __Heap Structure__:\n",
    "    * Heap  structure is another widely used tree structure with a specific ordering property.  There are two types of heap  - Min heap and Max heap. In a min heap the parent of a node must be smaller than the values of all its children.  Similarly in max heap the parent always have greater value compared to all its children. One common implementation of heap is Binary heap where each parent can have at most two children."
